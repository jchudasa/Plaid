Hi Amy,
I hope this email finds you well.
A public_token is a short-lived token (lasts 30 minutes) returned by Plaid when creating an item. The public_token is then exchanged for an access_token. The access_token can then be used to make requests against the item. Additional online support material can be found under our FAQ (https://support.plaid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008413793-Access-token-and-Item-FAQ#What%20are%20the%20differences%20among%20a%20public_token,%20access_token,%20and%20an%20item)
The INVALID_CREDENTIALS error, is a rejection message from the financial institution indicating your credentials provided were incorrect. I would suggest checking for typo on the credentials, and if you still face issues by trying login credentials against the financial institution website.

I have also included some additional online support material related to common [Errors](https://github.com/plaid/support/blob/master/errors.md) and [handling](https://support.plaid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012859833-Handling-Plaid-Errors) errors.

If you need any further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thank you,
